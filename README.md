# RedTelefonica

This projects simulates an app for a Telephone Company, making an telephone network with the most optimized path at that moment, showing it with an interface using JMapViewer.



## Features
This project contains different packages with different classes, and the more important ones are

### RedTelefonica
This class is the most important one, here we create the first network using an array of localities, optimizing the path trying to connect every localitie with just one path also being the
cheaper one. You can add a new localitie, remove an existing localitie, remove a desired path between two localities, or switch a path between two localities for a new one entered by the user.
For design reasons you can only work with a network of two or more localities, where each one need to have at least one valid path. Also, you can save your current network anytime and open it 
the next time you use the app.
